## Similar projects

* [Microsoft Graph JavaScript Client Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client) - The official JS/TS client;

* [GraphInterface](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GraphInterface) - The .NET version of this package.

## Why?

As you may noticed, there is already an [official package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/microsoft-graph-client) to deal with the Graph API requests, and it's very well done. It have all the abstractions and provides a nice API to work with.

However, some things are not available in the official package, like the ability to make massive requests and a simplified way to authenticate with the API.

In general, I would say that you probably should use the official package, but if you really need to make massive requests, you can use this package.
